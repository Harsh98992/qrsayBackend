# Service Configuration Documentation

This document describes the service configuration for the application.

## Services

The configuration file defines a list of services, each with its own set of routes. Below is an example of the configuration:

### node-app Service

- **Name**: `node-app`

The `node-app` service is configured with two routes, each mapping to a specific port on the application.

#### Routes

- **Route 1**:
  - **Path**: `/`
  - **Port**: `8080`
    - This is the port where one part of your Node.js application will be exposed.

- **Route 2**:
  - **Path**: `/`
  - **Port**: `8001`
    - This is the port for another part of your Node.js application.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
services:
  - name: node-app
    routes:
      - path: /
        port: 8080
      - path: /
        port: 8001
```

## Description

- The service is defined under the `services` key. 
- Each service has a name (e.g., `node-app`) and a list of routes.
- A route consists of:
  - `path`: The URL path that is associated with the route.
  - `port`: The port on which the part of the Node.js application should run.

This setup is useful for splitting different parts of the application across different ports while keeping them under the same service name.

## Notes

- Ensure that each port is available and not used by another process.
- You can add more routes as needed, each with its own path and port configuration.

This markdown documentation will help you or others understand the structure of the configuration file and how it maps to your service setup. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
