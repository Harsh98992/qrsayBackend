# Express.js Application Documentation

## Overview
This application is built using Express.js and serves as a RESTful API for managing various resources such as restaurants, dishes, users, customers, payments, and orders. It also integrates Google Maps functionality.

## Dependencies
The application requires the following Node.js packages:
- `express`: A web framework for Node.js.
- `cors`: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- `body-parser`: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- `request_trimmer`: A utility to trim request data.
- Custom modules for routing and error handling.

## Setup
To set up the application, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install express cors body-parser request_trimmer
```

## Application Structure
The application is structured into various routes, each handling specific API endpoints:

- **Restaurant Route**: Manages restaurant-related operations.
- **Dishes Route**: Handles operations related to dishes.
- **User Route**: Manages user-related functionalities.
- **Customer Route**: Handles customer-related operations.
- **Payment Route**: Manages payment processing.
- **Admin Route**: Handles administrative tasks.
- **Order Route**: Manages order processing.
- **Google Map Route**: Integrates Google Maps functionalities.

## Middleware
The application uses the following middleware:

- `express.json()`: Parses incoming JSON requests with a limit of 50mb.
- `trim_all`: Trims all incoming request data.
- `cors()`: Enables CORS for all routes.

## Routes
The following API endpoints are defined in the application:

- `POST /api/v1/restaurant`: Manage restaurants.
- `POST /api/v1/admin`: Admin functionalities.

## Export
The application is exported as a module for use in other parts of the application.

```javascript
module.exports = app;
```

## Conclusion
This Express.js application provides a robust framework for managing various resources through a RESTful API. Ensure to follow the setup instructions and explore the defined routes for full functionality.
