This is a website called qrsay which offers the ordering food platform. The code for the customer front end is in the digitalMenu\src\app\restaurant, and the admin frontend code is in the digitalMenu\src\app\admin.The back end is in qrsayBackend folder. The database is in the database folder.



 Add a small button called feedback like in the image on the website user side, which will open a popup to give feedback with
5 different emoji and also a optional text box. On the admin side make a component call to feedback which will show the feedback of each user. The user need not to be logged in so the feedback will be shown in the table form, which will show the emoji and the text. Make the required APIs in the back end for this functionality. Additionally, ensure that the feedback is stored in the database and can be retrieved for display in the admin panel. Also, consider implementing validation for the feedback submission to ensure quality input. Ensure that the feedback API supports both emoji and text input, and that the database schema is updated accordingly to store this information. Also, outline the necessary steps for creating the feedback component and the API endpoints required for submission and retrieval of feedback.
